Linear Regression using Gradient Descent algorithm
 This is an sample Linear Regression using Gradient Desent which is done for demostrating the Gradient Descent Algorithm. Basically Gradient Descent is an optmization algorithm which is used mostly in Deep Learning. So to demostrate the working of the Gradient Descent I have done a simple Linear Regression using Gradient Descent.
